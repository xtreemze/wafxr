# wafxr

[wafxr](https://github.com/andyhall/wafxr) is a sound effect generator in the tradition of
[as3fxr](http://www.superflashbros.net/as3sfxr/),
[bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/),
[jfxr](http://jfxr.frozenfractal.com/),
and so forth. It differs in that instead of generating sound files, it plays sounds
dynamically via WebAudio and [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/).

> [Demo](https://andyhall.github.io/wafxr/)

Supports various effects, filters, 3D panning, etc.
Internally it pools and reuses webaudio resources reasonably intelligently,
so it's probably about as light and performant as it can be. [(benchmark)](https://andyhall.github.io/wafxr/bench.html)

## Installation

```shell
npm install wafxr
```

## Usage

```js
var fx = require("wafxr");

fx.play({
  frequency: 440,
  sweep: 1.25
  // ...
});
```

To figure out what settings to pass in,
open the [demo](https://andyhall.github.io/wafxr/) page and play around.
Settings will appear at the bottom for copy/pasting.

## API

```js
fx.play(settings); // where the magic is

fx.getDefaults(); // object with all supported settings
fx.setVolume(0.5); // master volume, 0..1
fx._tone; // Tone.js reference if you need it

fx.setListenerPosition(x, y, z); // 3d sound stuff - these only
fx.setListenerAngle(degrees); // matter when soundX/Y/Z are set
```

## Notes

WIP. Not massively tested but seems to work in sane browsers.

Mobile support: Works On My Deviceâ„¢.
Might skip when more effects are used, of course.
